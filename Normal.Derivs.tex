During the discussion above we have been concerned with transforming a basis on a local triangle to
that of a basis on a reference triangle. However, we have not considered the implications that
results from the assumption of always rotating the normal derivative positive $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$.
If we always rotate positive $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$ there will be a jump discontinuity in the basis
function along that edge. 

This results from assuming $\dfrac{\partial\varphi_i}{\partial\mathbf{n}_i} = 1$ on triangle $I$
while at the same time assuming $\dfrac{\partial\varphi_i}{\partial\mathbf{n}_i} = -1$ on the
adjacent triangle $J$. The issue can be seen graphically in \autoref{fig:Normals}. This is what
causes the discontinuity along shared edges. To address this we need only multiply the value of
$\varphi_i$ by negative one on the triangle $J$, while leaving $\varphi_i$ alone on triangle $I$.

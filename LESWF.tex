In this section the functional setting for the LES form of the QGE \eqref{qge_psi_1} will be
presented. The weak formulation of the LES form of QGE will be different because LES requires a
closure model. This extra term will show up in the weak formulation as an additional form. However,
I don't believe the functional setting will change due to the extra term, but the extra term in the
weak formulation will result in a different FE formulation presented in \autoref{sec:LESFEF} and
therefore a difference in the error analysis presented in \autoref{sec:LESError}.

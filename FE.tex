In this chapter we introduce the conforming FE discretization of the QGE
(\autoref{sec:QGEFEM}), and SQGE (\autoref{sec:SQGEFEM}). Additionally, an in depth
discussion of the Argyris element and the transformation developed by Dominguez
et. al. \cite{Dominguez08} is discussed in \autoref{sec:Argyris}. Finally, we
introduce the two-level method applied to the SQGE in \autoref{sec:TwoLevel}.

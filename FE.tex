In this chapter we introduce the conforming FE discretization of the QGE
(\autoref{sec:QGEFEM}), and the SQGE (\autoref{sec:SQGEFEM}). Additionally, an
in depth discussion of the Argyris element and the transformation developed by
Dominguez et. al. \cite{Dominguez08} is presented in \autoref{sec:Argyris}.
Finally, we introduce the two-level method and apply it to the SQGE in
\autoref{sec:TwoLevel}.

Although, the streamfunction formulation of the QGE contains only one flow variable, the
streamfunction $\psi$, the streamfunction formulation of the QGE still suffers from having to solve
a large nonlinear system of equations. This is usually done by using a nonlinear solver, such as
Newton's Method. These nonlinear solvers typically require solving large linear systems multiple
times to obtain the solution to the nonlinear system. Solving these large linear systems multiple
times can be time consuming. Thus, a two-level algorthm can improve solve times greatly over the
standard non-linear sover, since we need only solve the non-linear system on a coarse mesh and then
use that solution to solve a linear system on a fine mesh. To this end, in this section discusses
the two-level finite element discretization for the pure streamfunction formulation of the SQGE and
QGE in $H^2$ norm.

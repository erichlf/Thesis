In this section we will present the functional setting for the FE formulation of the the
QGE \eqref{qge_psi_1} with LES applied to it. The FE formulation of the LES form of the
QGE differs from the standard FE formulation of the QGE, because of the added closure model.
Therefore, there should be an extra term corresponding to the closure model. This, I believe, will
not change the functional space for the weak formulation and therefore will not change the
functional space for the FE formulation. However, the error analysis that will be discussed in
\autoref{sec:LESError} will change due to the extra closure term.

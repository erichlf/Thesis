The Argyris finite element is implemented for each numerical test (described in
\autoref{sec:Tests}). A discussion of Argyris element was presented in \autoref{sec:FEM}. The
Argyris finite element is implemented on an initial mesh size of $h=\frac{1}{2}$
(\autoref{fig:Mesh}) for each numerical test , and then the mesh is refined by halving the size of
the triangle. The refined results correspond to a mesh size of $h=\frac{1}{4}$.  This process of
mesh refinement is repeated a total of four times resulting in numerical solutions for mesh sizes
corresponding to $h=\left\{\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{16},\frac{1}{32}\right\}$.

For the numerical tests that are nonlinear, Newton's method is used to solve the resulting
nonlinear system. The stopping criteria for Newton's method is satisfied when the residue and the
two norm of n$^th$ iterate of Newton's method is less than a given tolerance. If we write Newton's
method as 
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta_n \psi^h = -\mathcal{J}(\psi^h_{n-1})^{-1}\, F(\psi^h_{n-1}),
\end{equation*}
where $\Delta_n \psi^h = \psi^h_n - \psi^h_{n-1}$ is the n$^th$ iterate of Newton's method,
$\mathcal{J}(\psi^h_{n-1})$ is the Jacobian matrix evaluated at $\psi^h_{n-1}$, and $F(\psi^h_n-1)$
is the nonlinear problem we are solving evaluated at $\psi^h_{n-1}$ then the residue, $R$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
  R = \left|F(\psi^h_n)\right|
\end{equation*}
where $|\cdot|$ is the one-norm. In addition to the residue and iterate conditions for stopping
criteria Newton's method is required to terminate if a max number of iterations is exceeded. For
each numerical test the max number of iterations for Newton's is set to $100$ and the tolerance is
set to $10^{-8}$.

After the FE code is run for each $h$, the corresponding $\psi^h$ is used to calculate the errors $e_0,\, e_1,\text{
and } e_2$, where $e_0,\, e_1,\text{ and } e_2$ are the $L^2,\, H^1,$ and $H^2$ errors respectively, and are
given by 
%{\small
\begin{align*}
  e_0 &= \left(\int_{\Omega}\!\left( \psi^h - \psi \right)^2 \,d\vec{x}\right)^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\
  e_1 &= \left(e_0^2 + \int_{\Omega}\!  \left( \psi^h_x - \psi_x \right)^2 + \left( \psi^h_y - \psi_y \right)^2
    \,d\vec{x}\right)^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\
  e_2 &= \left(e_1^2 + \int_{\Omega}\!  \left( \psi^h_{xx} - \psi_{xx} \right)^2 + \left( \psi^h_{xy} - \psi_{xy}
    \right)^2 + \left( \psi^h_{yy} - \psi_{yy} \right)^2 \,d\vec{x}\right)^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\
\end{align*}

The order of convergence, $O$, is then determined by calculating 
\begin{equation*}
  O = \dfrac{\log e_{\alpha}^i - \log e_{\alpha}^{i-1}}{\log h_i - \log h_{i-1}},
\end{equation*}
where $e_{\alpha}^i$ is the i$^{th}$ $\alpha$-error corresponding to the i$^{th}$ mesh size, $h_i$. 

Additionally, in each of the convergence data tables we also present the number of degrees of freedom (DoFs) for Argyris
Finite Elements. For the uniform mesh as described above and a rectangular domain of length, $L$, and height, $H$, the
DoFs are given by
\begin{equation*}
  %DoF = 6\cdot\left(\frac{L}{h}+1\right)\cdot\left(\frac{H}{h}+1\right)+\frac{L}{h}\cdot\left(\frac{H}{h}+1\right)+\left(2\frac{L}{h}+1\right)\cdot\frac{H}{h}.
  N = \frac{7h\left(H + L\right) + 9 H L}{h^2} + 6.
\end{equation*}

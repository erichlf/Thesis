In this chapter we build the mathematical framework needed to apply the FEM. To,
this end we introduce the functional space required for the strong formulation
of the QGE, the weak formulation of SQGE, and we also discuss the well-posedness
of SQGE. All of which is a prerequisite to being able to both apply the FEM, as
is done in \autoref{ch:FEM}, and then for being able to prove error estimates,
as is done in \autoref{ch:Errors}.

In this section, we present the functional setting and some auxiliary results
for the FE discretization of the streamfunction formulation of the QGE
\eqref{eqn:QGEWF}. Let $\mathcal{T}^h$ denote a finite element triangulation of
$\Omega$ with mesh size (maximum triangle diameter) $h$. We consider a
\emph{conforming} FE discretization of \eqref{eqn:QGEWF}, i.e., $X^h \subset X
= H_0^2(\Omega)$.

The FE discretization of the streamfunction formulation of the QGE
\eqref{eqn:QGEWF} reads:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    &\text{Find } \psi^h \in X^h \text{ such that} \\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\nabla \psi^h, \nabla \chi^h)
      + Re^{-1} (\Delta \psi^h, \Delta \chi^h)
      &+ b(\psi^h,\psi^h,\chi^h)
      - Ro^{-1} (\psi_x^h,\chi^h)
      = Ro^{-1}(F,\chi^h),\quad \forall \, \chi^h \in X^h.
    \label{eqn:SemiDiscretization}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Using standard arguments \cite{Girault79,Girault86}, one can prove that, if the
small data condition used in proving the well-posedness result for the
continuous case holds, then \eqref{eqn:SemiDiscretization} has a unique solution
$\psi^h$ (see Theorem 2.1 in \cite{Cayco86}).

As noted in Section 6.1 in \cite{Ciarlet} (see also Section 13.2 in
\cite{Gunzburger89}, Section 3.1 in \cite{Johnson}, and Theorem 5.2 in
\cite{Braess}, in order to develop a conforming FE discretization for the QGE
\eqref{eqn:QGEWF}, we are faced with the problem of constructing subspaces of
the space $H^2_0(\Omega)$. Since the standard, piecewise polynomial FE spaces
are locally regular, this construction amounts in practice to finding FE spaces
$X^h$ that satisfy the inclusion $X^h \subset C^1({\bar \Omega})$, i.e., finding
$C^1$ finite elements.

Several finite elements meet this requirement (see, e.g., Section 6.1 in
\cite{Ciarlet}, Section 13.2 in \cite{Gunzburger89}, and Section 5 in
\cite{Braess}): the Argyris triangular element, the Bell triangular element, the
Hsieh-Clough-Tocher triangular element (a macroelement), and the
Bogner-Fox-Schmit rectangular element).

A description of the particular finite element we are using (the Argyris
triangle \autoref{fig:Argyris}) and its transformation will be thoroughly
discussed in \autoref{sec:Argyris}). Additionally, we note that
\eqref{eqn:SemiDiscretization} is only a semi-discretization, since the
formulation is still continuous in time, but discretized in space.  We apply the
the \emph{method of lines} (MoL) in the time domain, i.e. use a \emph{finite
difference} approximation for the time derivative.

%In what follows, we will use the Argyris triangular element, depicted in
%\autoref{fig:Argyris}.  Finite elements of class $C^1$ are of particular
%interest when employing conforming finite elements for the Steam function
%formulation of the QGE. If we are to require conforming finite elements,
%Lagrange finite elements are not enough to guarantee continuity in the first
%derivative, and so to ensure continuity in the first derivative \cite{Johnson}
%the Argyris Element (depicted in \autoref{fig:Argyris}) was implemented in our
%numerical tests. The Argyris element is probably the best known of all $C^1$
%finite elements \cite{Argyris,Dominguez06}, but appear to be rarely
%implemented.

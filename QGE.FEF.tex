In this section, we present the functional setting and some auxiliary results for the FEM
discretization of the streamfunction formulation of the QGE \eqref{eqn:QGEWF}. Let
$\mathcal{T}^h$ denote a finite element triangulation of $\Omega$ with meshsize (maximum triangle
diameter) $h$. We consider a \emph{conforming} FEM discretization of \eqref{eqn:QGEWF}, i.e., $X^h
\subset X = H_0^2(\Omega)$.

The FEM discretization of the streamfunction formulation of the QGE \eqref{eqn:QGEWF} reads: 
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    &\text{Find } \psi^h \in X^h \text{ such that} \\ 
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t} a_0(\psi^h,\chi^h) + a_1(\psi^h,\chi^h) + a_2&(\psi^h,\psi^h,\chi^h)
      + a_3(\psi^h,\chi^h) = \ell(\chi^h),\quad \forall \, \chi^h \in X^h.
    \label{eqn:QGEFE}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Using standard arguments \cite{Girault79,Girault86}, one can prove that, if the small data condition
used in proving the well-posedness result for the continuous case holds, then \eqref{eqn:QGEFE} has
a unique solution $\psi^h$ (see Theorem 2.1 in \cite{Cayco86}). 
%Furthermore, one can prove the
%following stability result for $\psi^h$ using the same arguments as those used in the proof of
%\eqref{thm:stability} for the continuous setting.
%\begin{theorem} \label{thm:stability_fem}
%The solution $\psi^h$ of \eqref{eqn:FEForm} satisfies the following stability estimate:
% \begin{equation}
%   |\psi^h|_2 
%   \le Re \, Ro^{-1} \, \| F \|_{-2} . 
%   \label{eqn:stability_fem_1}
% \end{equation}
%\end{theorem}

As noted in Section 6.1 in \cite{Ciarlet} (see also Section 13.2 in \cite{Gunzburger89}, Section 3.1
in \cite{Johnson}, and Theorem 5.2 in \cite{Braess}, in order to develop a conforming FEM for the
QGE \eqref{eqn:QGEWF}, we are faced with the problem of constructing subspaces of the space
$H^2_0(\Omega)$. Since the standard, piecewise polynomial FEM spaces are locally regular, this
construction amounts in practice to finding FEM spaces $X^h$ that satisfy the inclusion $X^h \subset
C^1({\bar \Omega})$, i.e., finding $C^1$ finite elements.

Several finite elements meet this requirement (see, e.g., Section 6.1 in \cite{Ciarlet}, Section
13.2 in \cite{Gunzburger89}, and Section 5 in \cite{Braess}): the Argyris triangular element, the
Bell triangular element, the Hsieh-Clough-Tocher triangular element (a macroelement), and the
Bogner-Fox-Schmit rectangular element).

A description of the particular finite element we are using (the Argyris triangle
\autoref{fig:Argyris}) and its tranformation will be thouroughly discussed in
\autoref{sec:Argyris}). Additionaly, \eqref{eqn:QGEFE} is only a semi-discretization, since the
formulation is still continuous in time, but discretized in space. Since there is no geometry in the
time domain it makes sense to apply what has been called the \emph{method of lines (MoL)} in the time
domain, i.e. use a \emph{finite difference} approximation for the time derivative. The MoL will be
discussed further in \autoref{sec:MoL}.

%In what follows, we will use the Argyris triangular element, depicted in \autoref{fig:Argyris}.
%  Finite elements of class $C^1$ are of particular interest when employing conforming finite elements
%  for the Steam function formulation of the QGE. If we are to require conforming finite elements,
%  Lagrange finite elements are not enough to guarantee continuity in the first derivative, and so to
%  ensure continuity in the first derivative \cite{Johnson} the Argyris Element (depicted in
%  \autoref{fig:Argyris}) was implemented in our numerical tests. The Argyris element is probably the
%  best known of all $C^1$ finite elements \cite{Argyris,Dominguez06}, but appear to be rarely
%  implemented.

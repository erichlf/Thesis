This paper introduced a conforming finite element discretization of the streamfunction formulation of the stationary one-layer quasi-geostrophic equations based on the Argyris element. 
For this finite element discretization, we proved optimal error estimates in the $H^2$, $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms.
A careful numerical investigation of the finite element discretization was also performed.
To this end, the quasi-geostrophic equations as well as the linear Stommel and Stommel-Munk models (two standard simplified settings used in the geophysical fluid dynamics literature \cite{Vallis06,Myers,Cascon}) were used in the numerical tests.
Based on the numerical results from the six tests considered, we drew the following two conclusions: (i) our numerical results are close to those used in the published literature \cite{Vallis06,Myers,Cascon}; and (ii) the convergence rates of the numerical approximations do indeed follow the theoretical error estimates in Theorems \ref{thm:EnergyNorm} and \ref{thm:Errors}.
The convergence rates followed exactly the theoretical ones in the test problems where the exact solution did not display a thin boundary layer, but where somewhat lower than expected in those tests that displayed a thin western boundary layer, as expected.

We plan to extend this study in several directions, including the time-dependent quasi-geostrophic equations and the two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations.

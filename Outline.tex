The rest of the paper is organized as follows: \autoref{sec:QGE} presents the
QGE, and \autoref{sec:SQGE} presents the stationary QGE. Then
\autoref{ch:WellPosed} will discusses the mathematical framework of both the QGE
and SQGE.  In \autoref{ch:FEM} we outline the FEM discretization for the QGE
(\autoref{sec:QGEFEM}), and SQGE (\autoref{sec:SQGEFEM}, with special emphasis
placed on the Argyris element in \autoref{sec:Argyris}. Additional, a discussion
of the two-level method is presented in \autoref{sec:TwoLevel}. Rigorous error
estimates for the FE discretization both the SQGE, the Two-Level method applied
to SQGE, and QGE are derived in \autoref{sec:SQGEErrors}, \autoref{sse:SQGE2LE},
and \autoref{sec:QGEError} , respectively.  Several numerical experiments
supporting the theoretical results for the QGE, SQGE and the Two-Level method
are presented in \autoref{sec:QGETests}, \autoref{sec:SQGETests}, and
\autoref{sec:SQGE2LTests}. These numerical experiments also tackle geophysical
flows in realistic complex geometries with realistic parameter values. Finally,
conclusions are included in \autoref{ch:Conclusions}.

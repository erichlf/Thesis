The rest of the paper is organized as follows: \autoref{sec:QGE} presents the
QGE, and \autoref{sec:SQGE} presents the stationary QGE. Then
\autoref{ch:WellPosed} will discusses the well posedness of both the QGE and
SQGE with special attention paid to the weak formulations and the mathematical
support for the weak formulation presented in \autoref{sec:QGEWeak} and
\autoref{sec:SQGEWeak} for the QGE and SQGE, respectively. In \autoref{ch:FEM}
we outline the FEM discretization for the QGE (\autoref{sec:QGEFEM}), and SQGE
(\autoref{sec:SQGEFEM}, with special emphasis placed on the Argyris element in
\autoref{sec:Argyris}. Additional, a discussion of the Two-Level method is
presented in \autoref{sec:TwoLevel}. Rigorous error estimates for the FE
discretization and the Two-Level method applied to the stationary QGE are
derived in \autoref{sec:SQGEErrors} and \autoref{sse:SQGE2LE}, respectively.
Several numerical experiments supporting the theoretical results for the SQGE
and the Two-Level method are presented in \autoref{sec:SQGETests} and
\autoref{sec:SQGE2LTests}. Finally, conclusions are included in
\autoref{ch:Conclusions}.

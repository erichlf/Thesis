In this section we will present numerical tests to verify the theoretical error bounds derived in
\autoref{sec:QGEError}. The numerical tests will be very similar to those used in
\autoref{sse:SQGE}, except that the exact solution will have time dependence added to it. This will
allow us to verify the rates of convergence in both the spatial domain and in the time domain.
